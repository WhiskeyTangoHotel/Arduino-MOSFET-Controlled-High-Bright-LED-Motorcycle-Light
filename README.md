In our modern world, high bright LEDs can be purchased cheaply to provide low current draw auxiliary lighting to any vehicle.  
Then it is only a simple matter of connecting the LED to 12VDC and head down the road enjoying your new found wattage.  
However, there is no fun in the easy way.  Follow the instructions below to build your own custom high bright LED driver.
